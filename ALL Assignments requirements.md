INTRODUCTION TO YOUR CONSULTANTS REPORT
## 1. BACKGROUND
IT consultants work in a variety of contexts. They may be partners in an IT consulting firm or they may be part of an organisation’s internal consulting team. They may be technical specialists, management specialists or a combination of the two.
This assessment is designed to help you gain the critical, analytical, and communication skills expected of an IT professional (technical or managerial) who can operate as a consultant.
## 2. YOUR CLIENT AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS
Typically, a client asks a consultant to recommend how to solve a problem for them. The consultant then:
helps the client articulate the real problem
<ul>
<li>researches the evidence on the relevant topics,</li>
<li>analyses the evidence s/he finds</li>
<li>develops options on how to solve the problem</li>
<li>makes recommendations (i.e. presents the evidence persuasively) to her/his client, in an oral presentation and a written report</li>
</ul>
Your client is The Newtown Bank. The bank’s profits are declining and it is particularly concerned by the role of its IT infrastructure in this. The bank needs a consultant to carry out the five steps above with a particular focus on adopting three IT strategies that might help them:
### 1. Service-oriented enterprise and IT architecture, and microservices
### 2. Sourcing external services (outsourcing) including cloud services
### 3. IT governance, service management and DevOps
The document Newtown Bank Ltd. Increasing profitability with IT infrastructure: Client Brief for Consultants Report describes the Newtown Bank’s business, corporate structure, IT infrastructure, the problem and its causes, the IT goals and IT strategies and its requirements for your Consultants Report.
## 3. STRUCTURE OF YOUR WORK ON THE CONSULTANTS REPORT
Your work on the report is broken down into stages, so that we can give you feedback at each stage that will help you with the next stage. The first two stages are done individually and the final two stages in groups of three different specialists. The following information is a summary, full information about each assignment can be found on Canvas in the Assignments Module
### 3.1 In Assignment 2: 
Constructing a synthesis grid for your Consultants Report (Individual), you search for sources of evidence relevant to Newtown Bank’s IT goals about ONE of the three IT strategies above which you have chosen as your specialisation. You evaluate these sources according to the R.E.V.I.E.W. criteria on the Library’s website, organise information from them into a synthesis grid, cite each article, and create a glossary and bibliography.
### 3.2 Based on the feedback you get from that assignment, in Assignment 3: 
Summary and draft recommendations for your Consultants Report (Individual), you write a summary of the main ideas in your synthesis grid relevant to Newtown Bank that you have drawn from your sources draft
recommendations for using your IT strategy to help them.
### 3.3 After Assignment 3, 
you will form a group of three with two specialists in the other IT strategies to combine your expertise (and the insights from the feedback on Assignment 3) to draft the final report for your client.

Presentation of your recommendations from the Consultants Report (Group) is an oral presentation of your report, at which you will be given feedback on improvements to include in your Assignment 5: Consultants Report (Group).
